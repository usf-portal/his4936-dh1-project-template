This visualization show how much less of the Medal of Honor recipients are actually still on earth. This is not surprising because the Medal of Honor has been awarded to people for over a hundred years. So, the number of recipients of the Medal of Honor who are still on this earth is much less than the number of recipients who have passed away.
