# Initial Findings

My initial finding after analyzing cluster C1 is the only thing tying the emails in the cluster together was the fact each referenced Benghazi, but in the subclusters, there were several common themes, including foreign policy, national security, and the U.S. 2012 presidential election. My analysis of one subcluster revealed to me Libyan President Mohammed Ussef el Magariaf's concern foreign investors would see the country as unstable if he was unable to find the militants who murdered Ambassador Chris Stephens in Benghazi, and his belief several of them were being funded by al Qaedaa [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). My examination of a second subcluster revealed Hillary's inner circle was concerned about the effect Benghazi would have on U.S. policy in Libya, especially projects America had already begun implementing in the country[(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). My analysis of a third revealed to me how eager the GOP was to make it an issue (one Romney advisor called it a gift to the campaign) and the frustration of Clinton's supporters the issue did not disappear, one of whom asked why it had not be consigned to the "sad and sealed file of Americans killed abroad in dangerous line of duty" [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). Given I learned all this information from a cluster of roughly 20 emails out of 30,000 total, I believe there is much more that could be learned if scholars chose to analyze the data further; additional analysis of related clusters might reveal some of Benghaziâ€™s effects on Libya's economy and relationship with America. 

However, conducting more thorough analysis demands a larger team - this is not a project one person can tackle - with technical skill, and if possible, more powerful technology. Since I conducted the research on my own and due to time constraints, I was only able to look at a single cluster; a larger team with more resources, in contrast, could do a more in-depth analysis of Clinton's emails. Scholars will also need technical expertise as my limited knowledge and skills hampered my ability to analyze the data by preventing me from using hierarchical clustering programs that would have aided my project. Finally, scholars will need better technology - I had to limit the size of the file I ran on Orange so my computer could process it; scholars with more powerful technology than what I have access to would be able to do higher quality research by analyzing a larger sample.
