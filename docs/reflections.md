# Problems and Possibilities

Although in the end I did not get to answer the questions I was searching for. Not only did I have problems with the editing and the process of trying to create a visualization, what I though would be a sure bet, in terms of finding infromation, the Mexican government website. It was impossible to find the specific information I was lookign for.

I also had a hard finding some sort of historiography that syntisizes history and health into one topic.

I, at the beginning of the process did think that working with Github and Atom would be a lot more difficult than it was, but it was surpringly easy to work with, which did make the not finished process easier to handle.

If I have another chance to do something like this again I will be working with others, this process has been a difficult one. If I did have more time either in class or out of class I would have focused more on the editing process and Tableau. I do believe another semester would be very benefical in not only answering the questions this project tried to answer but in having a better understanding in the different processes.
