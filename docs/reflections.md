# Problems and Possibilities


If the group had more training and time, I would loved to have been able to create an interactive map. Color coding ships with the goods they were carrying was also a goal we were trying to achieve. Overall, the project ran pretty smooth with minimal bumps. Without having to webscrape and being able to export the websites list right to Tableau made this project a breeze. 

The hardest part of the project was Tableau. Not being able to visualize the goods carried was frustrating & made me have to refocus the project. The final result of the project is not what we originally had in mind but we adapted quickly and changed focus to the Roman Empire. We originally wanted to make the original map interactive to where you could click a node and the node would travel from its origin to its destination but quickly figured out that the type of visualization we wanted was a tad too advanced for this class. If we were given another semester on Tableau I believe this goal is something that could be realized. 

The most useful tool of the project was OpenRefine, without this tool visualizing the project would have been an absolute nightmare. In total, import to export, cleaning the entire excel file took us around 5-10 minutes. Without this tool the amount of time to self-edit the excel spreadsheet would have taken hours. I think the strength of our project is how clean the layout is without any markdown errors. Being an Information Technology major made this project easy to edit.
