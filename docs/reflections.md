# Problems and Possibilities

The hardest thing for me while working on my project was getting Orange3 to analyze Clinton's emails on my computer. I had to download Orange on two computers before I was able to find one that would run Orange and let it analyze the data. After I downloaded Orange, I had to reduce the size of the CSV file from seventeen thousand to around three thousand emails because my computer was not powerful enough to run Orange on such a large file. Since I did not choose the emails randomly - I selected the first three thousand in the CSV file  - the data is not representative, which limits the ability of myself and others to use it to draw conclusions about the entire set of 30,000 emails in the archive. Thankfully, these were the only problems I encountered when trying to use Orange3 and when analyzing the CSV.

However, I also experienced problems trying to locate sources for my historiography and digital scholarship. Hierarchical clustering is a significant part of my project, but I was unable to find articles discussing its use in the digital humanities because the field is so young; I have no doubt someone has written about their use of hierarchical clustering, but at this point, I could not find articles on it. Prof. David J. Thomas informed me I needed to narrow my search, suggested I look at _Digital Humanities Quarterly_ for sources and sent me some articles addressing text analysis I used to construct my historiography and digital scholarship [(Thomas, David)] (https://github.com/thePortus). Without Prof. Thomas' help, I probably would not have been able to complete those sections of the project.

In contrast to those problems though, I consider one of the project's strengths to be what it can teach scholars and the public about the events during Clinton's tenure as Secretary of State. Orange3's hierarchical clustering allowed me to see how politically siginificant Republicans considered Bengazhi and how annoyed Clinton's supporters were the issue would not go away. The fact a Romney advisor called the brutal murder of four people a "gift to the campaign" is both appalling and at the same time not surprising given how easily it could be used to attack a sitting president [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). At the same time, one of Clinton's supporters asking why the public had not consigned Bengazhi to the "same sad and sealed file of Americans killed abroad on dangerous duty" is somewhat understandable given the political and legal issue it became while showing a lack of appreciation for the lives lost [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). I would never have discovered those comments if I had not used Orange, and I am surprised how well it grouped emails together and recommend scholars interested in conducting text analysis consider the program. 

For those considering further research of Clinton's emails, establishing a timeline of Benghazi and tracing how Clinton, her opponents, and her supporters' views of Benghazi changed as it developed into a political and legal issue would be an easy way to expand the project. A larger team with greater technical skill and more powerful computers could lay the foundation for the project. Scholars and the public would benefit from learning about Benghazi, and  how leaders think about and address political and legal problems, which allow the people to make more informed decisions - whether interpreting leaders actions or choosing who the leaders will be - in the future.
