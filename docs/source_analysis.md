# Source Analysis
Digital Scholarship:

The ArcGIS website gives a tutorial section on how to create different types of maps with data from CSV files. The file provided with this particular tutorial is that of deaths during the Easter Rising with about 216 people. The file contains: names, ages, gender, exact coordinates of their death, affiliation, religion, dates of birth and death, and even occupation. The main issue with this source is that the data skews heavily towards the Irish side of the Rebellion. The 216 people on the list provided are almost entirely listed as either civilian or as part of the Irish resistance. This must be noted because it skews how the information will be visualized and leaves many questions left unfulfilled in a truly meaningful manner. When put in conversation with the PDF list from the Glasnevin Trust, it helps understand the affiliations of nearly all who died, but by its lonesome, it is mostly only good for creating maps within the ArcGIS system. This is still the main source for most of the Tableau visualizations regardless because it is the only source found that has information such as age, religion, and career to name a few.

The Glasnevin Trust conducted a large research effort to gather every name of those who died during the 1916 Easter Rising. This list is an on-going project that was started for the centennial of the Rebellion. The list itself comprises of 485 names and has a section on the website to add the information of a family member who you believed died during the Rebellion. The stated goal of the website is to get a comprehensive list of everyone who died (including the British soldiers and other British sympathizers). The only pieces of information given by the list are: Name, Initials, Date of Death, and Affiliation. Some of these categories are not filled out because the record does not exist. The source is not complete, just like the list from the ArcGIS website, but it has more names and listed affiliations. The PDF with the list does not give age or sex, which makes the list pretty bare bones when it comes to giving information, but the affiliations are good to know since the ArcGIS list is more heavily focused on the Irish side we can see a larger view of those who died and on which side they were on (if any).

The newspaper, The Irish Times, created a site connected to their main website concerning the Easter Rising of 1916 before the centennial celebration. The website is continuously updated and pertinent information about the rebellion is periodically added. The website provides a basic history of events and has a features section which includes: the main players, interactive maps, why 1916 matters, 1916: then and now, the proclamation, 1916 day by day and videos. Each section is an attempt to make the reader feel more intimate with the Easter Rising of 1916. The site also provides a list of articles the paper has published over its long history about the rebellion. The downfall of the site is that it does not provide where it obtained its information on the event and some of the sections are less than satisfying in the way in which they present their findings.

Boston College, in collaboration with segments of the Irish government and The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, created a digital project covering the Easter Rising of 1916. The project was finalized in 2013 and respectfully named, The Century Ireland Project. It is an online newspaper that “…tells the story of events of the Irish life a century ago” and maintained by RTÉ News and Current Affairs. This project is similar yet more inclusive than the project done by The Irish Times newspaper however, it has not been updated since 2013. The Century Ireland Project site provides the viewer with seven primary sections: basic features, galleries, people and places, film, background, listen and education. The most unique aspect of this project is the listen section which provides audio of conversations between historians about the rebellion and readings of the primary sources. The site also provides where, when and how it collected its datasets and sources.

The National Library of Ireland created a digital archive in 2016 regarding the Easter Rising of 1916. Their reason for creating the archive was to “…record the online life of Ireland on the 100th anniversary of 1916, capturing and preserving the content of key websites that tell our 2016 story. By collecting these websites, the NLI will be contributing to the national conversation around commemoration by providing a unique contemporary online record of Ireland’s 2016 local, state, and international commemorative events.” The site provides documents and photographs related to seven signatories of the Proclamation who died in 1916. The people included are: Eamonn Ceannt, Thomas J. Clarke, Joseph Mary Plunkett, James Connolly, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Henry Pearse and Sean MacDiarmada. By clicking on any of these peoples’ names the user is brought to The National Library of Ireland Catalogue. The catalogue provides the digitized writings of each of the signatures mentioned above.
