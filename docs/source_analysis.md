# Source Analysis

## Basic Source Information

The source is an online archive hosted by WikiLeaks, [https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/), consisting of 30,000 emails from Hillary Clinton's private email address released by the State Department and located at https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/.


## Authorship

According to WikiLeaks, on March 16, 2016, it designed an engine to search through the roughly 30,000 emails released by the State Dept. as PDFs, [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). The State Department released them following a Freedom of Information Act request by Jason Leopold of Vice News  [(Brennan and Reid, 2015)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/state-dept-to-comply-with-court-order-on-hillary-clintons-emails/). Aside from that, however, WikiLeaks gives visitors no other information about the project - aside from that it lets users search by term or email ID number [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/).



WikiLeaks states on its "About" page it wants to promote transparency to reduce corruption in government, business, and other institutes  [(WikiLeaks, 2011)](https://wikileaks.org/About.html). However, WikiLeaks founder and leader Julian Assange made comments in 2015 that suggest he wanted Hillary to lose the Presidential election, which means it is likely there was an ulterior motive in their construction of the dataset [(Currier and Lee, 2018)](https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/julian-assange-wikileaks-election-clinton-trump/).

## Data Analysis

  The emails reflect the views of Hillary Clinton and the people she is closest to - politically and otherwise, while their digitization reflects Julian Assange's anti-Clinton stance - the search engine facilitates a user's ability to sift through her emails and find details damaging to Clinton. However, in contrast to these individuals, Jason Leopold seems to have no motive in filing an FOIA other than wanting to break a story.
