## Data Analysis

* Governments taking census has been a regular practice for thousands of years to keep records of its citizens. These
  records very likely can and are used for political reasons, but that would not necessarily create a bias in the actual data. 
* The data on the website is visualized in the form of a Tree Map for both Education and Employment sections.
* The data provided an annual view between 2013 and 2016 of number/percentage of employees based on their occupation/industry.
* We found these graphs intriguing when comparing educational records- which provides the number of bachelor degree graduates
  in Tampa per field of study.
