## Authorship

* Is there any information available discussing the process by which the information was gathered, or how the digital project was constructed?
	* Julia Strauss has updated the database by going systematically through the relevant maritime archaeology journals and other literature published since 1992.

* How transparent is the project about the choices they made in gathering and transforming the data for digitalization?
	* They classify how the database was formed and any exceptions made of what they included in the database. For instance, they excluded all information they believed was just dumped overboard rather than an actual shipwreck. ONLY shipwrecks from trade ships are included in this database. 

* Do the organizations or individuals involved in gathering and publishing your data set have any stated goals or agendas?
	* o	To address the fundamentals of the Roman Imperial economy & analysis of all major economic activities. 

* Do the organizations or individuals involved seem to have any unstated agendas or goals?
	* o	I do not believe they do as this is a straightforward database about the Ancient Roman, and surrounding areas, economy via shipwrecks and Amphora analysis. 
	
* If a 3rd party funded the project, who are they? Do they have any particular perspective?
	* This project was funded by two sources:
	* Arts and Humanities Research Council – This source seems to Donate a large amount to College Departments for research opportunities. 
	* Baron Lorne Thyssen – A collector of Ancient Shipwreck coins, silver, and statuary. He is a supporter of ancient archaeology and research.

## Data Analysis

* Do the datasets involved reflect the viewpoints of particular groups or institutions, and if so, who?
	* No as it is a dataset of recorded ancient shipwrecks.

* What kinds of categorizations do you find in the data, and do they seem reasonable?
	* Wreck site, wreck name, sea area, country, region, latitude and longitude (where available), period, place of origin and place of destination (as far as possible), minimum and maximum depths, and a selection of cargo finds.
	
* Does the website contain any tools for visualizing the data? Do they seem like they are making any kind of arguments?
	* The website offers a frozen version of the Database in an Excel sheet. Making data visualization extremely easy as you do not have to webscrape before importing into Tableau.
