# Problems and Possibilities

The major difficulty which was encountered while scraping was the challenge of trying to get the data to scrape information from all of the pages, not just pages one through 9. Lucas was able to figure out how to use adequate pagination in order to get the scraper to scrape the date from all of the pages. Other than this, I think it was not too difficult to get the data scraped from the website. So, I think that the most difficult part of this project was the scraping. Other than this, I think the project went smoothly. 

The only real problem with trying to vizualize the data was trying to get the visualizations of specific geographic locations on a map. While geographic data could not be visualized on a map, there was other data that could be visualized. 

I think that one thing which made this project work was the adequacy of the website for scraping purposes. It appeared that the website was structured appropriately for scraping purposes.

I think that, if this project could be contineud into another semester, it would be interesting to tryto figure out how to display geographic locations on Tableau. This would be an interesting form of visualization.
