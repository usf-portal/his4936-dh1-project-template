# Workflow

Describe your overall workflow here.

David Thomas provided us with txt files of oral history transcripts from ACT UP's online oral history repository. From those txt files we were able to upload them into Orange Three and Voyant. The data derived was successfully uploaded into Tableau and was analyzed using a sentiment analysis tool. Below we will discuss the various approaches we used to derive data and meaning from the original txt files. 


Discuss (in detail) the processes of

* Getting the data
* Cleaning/altering the data
* Visualizing the data
* Discussing and sharing results with group members

What you need to cover: Talk about every step in your process, talk about how and why you made the decisions that you did. Why did you pick the website that you did? Did you download every record, or just some? Did you download the data directly from the website, or did you use a tool like Webscraper.io? Did you use OpenRefine to change the raw data in some form, and if so, why did you change it the way you did? What program(s) or techniques did you decide on to visualize or analyze it? Why did you feel those programs (e.g. Tableau or Gephi) were better than other options, given your research interest? Did you have to do anything to the data inside Tableau?
