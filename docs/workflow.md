# Workflow

Our group decided to do research on the amount of United States casualties in the second World War. As we began our research, certain tasks were divided amoung the two of us in order to breakdown the project. Amoung these tasks, Tony was in charge of gathering data, writing the historiography and analyzing all of the raw data. Steven was choosen as the group leader and was in charge of collecting all the data, uploading the data sent from Tony in GitHub, creating visualizations. Once the tasks were divided, our group came into some conflicting issues, causing the two of us to overlap on workflow topics. 
As our project began to develop, we found a data set from the National Archives and Records website which narrowed down our research. Once we decided on a World War II topic, we decided to breakdown the amount of casualties by individual state. Once our main data set was obtained, we decided to work closer together than innitially planed. At first we intended to work on this project seperatley and to contact eachother via email. Though as the project developed, our group began to share the work load by meeting up on various occasions to complete sections of the project together.
