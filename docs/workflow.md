# Workflow

The process of getting the data and visualizing it was divided between myself and Lucas. Lucas and I prepared the siremap on Web Scraper. Lucas was able to scrape the data from the website and convert it into a Microsoft Excel. I was able to clean up the Excel spreadsheet by adjusting the width of the different columns. Then, I imported the information from the spreadsheet into Tableau for visualization. I made a number of visualizations of the data which can show interesting historical information. For example, a bar graph shows which branch cointains the most Medal of Honor recipeints who are still on earth. Also, another graph shows which ranks in which branch recieved the most Medals of Honors. Visualizing this data was useful in asking and answering historical questions.
