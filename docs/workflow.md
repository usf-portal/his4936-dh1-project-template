*Getting Data*

Data was retrieved from Tampa, census. Downloaded directly from [Datausa.io]( https://datausa.io/profile/geo/tampa-fl/)

*Planning*

While viewing the data the initial plan was to compare access to education to achieved employment. It was realized that the amount of data available was overwhelming. By narrowing to a specific field with correlating research data the plan was altered to focus specifically on the Nursing field and its education success vs occupation need. The appropriate data was selected. 

*Cleaning data*

Applied data to open refine to check for errors and discrepancies, nothing needed to be altered. 

*Visualization*

Utilized Tableau to visualize differences in data pools. Created Three sepeart sheets for Graduation numbers, Industry size, and Occupation count. This graph allowed easy viewing of disparities in the data. Through this and further research we homed in on nursing and the large gap between need and availability.
