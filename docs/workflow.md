# Workflow

When it came to researching and gathering data from the various databases, I ran into the problem of having too much data and I had to decide what I wanted to use and what I did not think was useful for this project. For me to do that I looked at how the information compared to the rest of the data from the other sources I used. What made it easier was the fact that I focused on the years 2000 to 2016, since most of these sources only went up to 2016 anyway.
Once I gathered all of the data I believed to be necessary, I downloaded it and used OpenRefine to clean it up.

The websites I used for this project, like [UN Aids](unaids.org), are natioanlly and internationally known to have accurate information. This is important for any type of data gathering, but it is especially important when it come to health.  Some of the other websites that I used were not as recognized which could be a negative. For example [World Population Review](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mexico-population/) has a good amount of ads and, at least to me, that can be a bad thing. For the most part I downloaded the data sets and other information, but in one case, with (http://healthdata.org/geography/mexico) I had to download the data for each year instead of having all of the infromation being consolidated. But as for the other sources, I could download everything at once in one file. One tool I believed I would be using at the beginning of this process was WebScrapper, which made me a little nervous, but since all of the data I gathered was downloadable it made the whole process a little easier for me.

 I took out the infromation that I did not believe was necessary for the quesions that I am asking. I if it was a table or graph. For example for this data, from the World Health Organization, I took out information about the median income. Which is does impact the health of Mexico's citizens, but I decided to take it out because it has no real impact to the information I am trying to collect.

I tried make some sort of table, bar or line graph but I could not figure out what I did wrong, I do believe that the mistakes I made were most likely made before I loaded all of the data on Tableau and tried to edit it.

I tried again to edit the data from the World Health Organization, this time I had better luck with it since it was more familiar and again I loaded the information on Tableau and I had the same result. The visualization I tried to make did come out a little better than the first time, which meant I was doing something right, but I did not know what.
