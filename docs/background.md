# Project Background

---

Put a general discussion of your topic here. Don't get into the historiography or scholarship here. Just introduce to your reader what your topic is. What is the 'problem', the 'question', and/or the 'argument'.

## Historical Background

Put a discussion of any relevant historigraphy you think relates to the topic.You can discuss the historiography of specific times and places, but you can also discuss any theoretical literature you think is relevant.

You have freedom to roam from the narrow topic of your project to explore how different authors/schools of thought have impacted scholarly approaches over time. However, make sure that in the end you clearly relate how this discussion relates to the subject of your project and/or your choices in methods or interpreative models.

As you discuss different authors, you may site them using (author, page) style parenthetical notation. Make sure that a full citation in [Chicago](http://chicagomanualofstyle.org) is added to the 'docs/credits.md' page.

## Digital Background

You should also make sure to do research on any relevant digital work, whether scholarly articles or digital projects. Make sure to check Digital Humanities Quarterly, or [DHQ](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/), [Debates in the Digital Humanities](http://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/), [JStor](https://jstor.org), blogs and more to find relevant work.

You don't actually have to have a sepearte 'Digital Background' section. If it feels more natural to you, you may combine them into a single discussion. This is especially a good idea if you feel that with your topic you cannot talk about historiography without also talking about digital scholarship, and vice versa.
