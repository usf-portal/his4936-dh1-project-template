# Project Background

---
There has been a good amount of research and study that has been done on the health of Mexico's citizens. What I want to find out is whether it has gotten worse or better overtime, why and how. Although some of the research that I have found does show the most recent information, all of them do not show the expected data, in one case the Health Organization did show what they expected whould happen along with the information they gathered (http://www.healthdata.org/mexico?language=41). The projections of the data they, the different organizations, gathered are also not shown. The follow up of the different organizations, in terms of whether the situation has gotten better, if at all is not there.

## Background

There have been discussions about the health and the history of Mexico and its people together, most of the information I gathered either does not mention the health side of history, in this case from January 2000 to the most recent data I can gather, or how the health of Mexico's citizens has palyed a role in they themselves making history. I did realize that the dates I chose might have to do with this situation.
Because of this I have focused more on the health side of the problem. From the research that I have done, some of the data, like that of UNAIDS (http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/mexico) does go up to 2017, while others, the lastest information that is avaliable is from 2016.
