# Project Background

---
 I chose to analyze WikiLeaks' archive of Hillary Clinton's emails to try and learn about Benghazi, and chose to analyze her emails because it is a political topic, and I am interested in politics. What I learned is Libya's president at least initially believed militants had infiltrated protests against an anti-Islam video to attack Benghazi; I also learned of his concern foreign businesses would see the country as unstable if he was unable to eliminate the militants [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/). I also learned of the GOP's eagerness to use Benghazi for their political gain, and the annoyance of Clinton's allies people refused to move on [(WikiLeaks, 2016)](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/).

## Historical and Digital Background

Part of the historiography of text analysis is the "Gender, Race, and Nationality in Black Drama, 1950-2006: Mining Differences in Language Use in Authors and their Characters" [(Argamon et al., 2009)](http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/3/2/000043/000043.html). The authors discuss their use of text analysis to test whether techniques can tell the difference between authors of different gender, race, and nationality (Argamon et al., 2009). Though the scholars were successful in their efforts, it was only after normalizing the data that they were able to use the techniques to determine author and character gender, which they fear puts distance between the text the and reader and limit the ability of readers interpret text with text analysis (Argamon et al., 2009). Argamon and his team point out focusing on only simple categories may prevent analysis of complex themes using text analysis or reinforce the biases of authors by "confirming" what they set out to prove (Argamon et al., 2009).

Another part of the historiography of text analysis and a rebutal to "Gender" is Dr. Meehan's "Text Minding"  [(Meehan, 2009)](http://digitalhumanities.org:8081/dhq/vol/3/2/000045/000045.html). Dr. Meehan agrees with Argamon and his coauthor' argument technology may force sources to fit models that are too simple; however, unlike Argamon, Meehan states technology could aid research (Meehan, 2009). If scholars familiarize themselves with technology and combine it with traditional tools, it could enable them to find its shortcomings and learn how to circumvent epistemological impediments posed by technology, just as Fredrick Douglas was able to overcome the binarity of slavery by familiarizing himself with and exploring how slavery advocates contrasted slaves with the free (Meehan, 2009). 

The relevance of these articles for using text analysis on WikiLeaks' archive of Clintons' emails is that though scholars should be cautious about using techological tools - because they are as flawed as the people who made them  - the way for scholars to prevent themselves from being constrained is to educate themselves on how technology works and combine it with other analytical aids (Aramon et al., 2009 and Meehan, 2009). As I and others familiarize ourselves with Orange3, we will begin to understand the shorcomings of text analysis and digital techniques in general (Meehan, 2009). A better understanding of technology, in turn, will allow scholars to find novel ways to analyze text, and possibly increase the breadth and depth of humanistic study (Meehan, 2009). Therefore, projects using text analysis to study Clinton's emails are useful as they give scholars the ability to conduct more sophisticated research on a subject _and_ the opportunity to familiarize themselves with technology.
