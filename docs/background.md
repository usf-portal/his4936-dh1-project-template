# Project Background

---

Our research topic is trade in the ancient Mediterranean. The dataset we will be using shows, for most ships at least, where the ships origin and the ships destination as well as the ships cargo. This valuable information can help us explore many questions about trade in the ancient world. 

The questions we aim to answer with or data visualization project are as follows:
* Who was the central hub of trade in the ancient Mediterranean.
* What goods/services were the most commonly traded.
* With visualization of the wrecks, can we find the trade routes used?

The database covers all ancient shipwrecks known currently up to 1500 AD. The database contains a little over 600 entries with a vast variety of different cultures represented. The database focuses on 3 main categories of cargo.
* Amphoras, Marble and Sarcophagus.

## Historical Background

The ancient shipwrecks of the Mediterranean date all the way back to the Classical period in the years 400-500 BC. Ships from the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, and Ottoman Empire were found in recent years. The Black Sea is a particularly good location where historians have found numerous shipwrecks. The reason why is because there is an anoxic layer in the sea that allows the ships to stay preserved. The Aegean sea is another popular hotspot where ships have been found. Twenty-two Greek vessels were found Fourni archipelago in the eastern Aegean Sea, they date between 700 and 480 B.C. Archaeologists are able to date the ships by studying the shapes and sizes of the clay jars they carried. One social aspect that historians have discovered about maritime disasters is that women have a much higher survival rate, which can be due to the fact that women are given priority in survival equipment. Overall, there are an estimated 3 million shipwrecks across the worlds ocean. However, there may be many more discoveries to come!

## Digital Background

The Oxford Roman Economy has a brilliant digital project and visualizations for every database they have collected. They have interactive LIVE maps that are updated whenver the database is updated. Although that type of project is far beyond our data visualization skills it was interesting to create our own project with a different mindset and different types of visualizations.
