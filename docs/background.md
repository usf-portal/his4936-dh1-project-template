**The Rising:**

On Monday April 24, 1916 members of the Irish Volunteers, Na Fianna Éireann, the Irish Citizens Army, and Cumann na mBan received less then an hour’s notice to complete a four hour process of mobilization. This order was given in such a disorganized fashion that one Volunteer received orders at 10 a.m. to have his company ready and mobilized at 10 a.m.<sup>1</sup>  This chaotic scramble was the first step in what would become the Easter Rising of 1916. Fearghal McGarry argues that the disappointing attendance among the Volunteers was due to the combination of the hectic way in which troops were informed and the fact that the order was not given by the Irish Volunteers’ commanding officer, Eoin MacNeill, causing those assembled to be about one-third their enlisted battalion numbers, less than 1,000 soldiers.<sup>2</sup>  In contrast, the Irish Citizens’ Army and their female branch, Cumann na mBan, had 219 respond to the call to arms, almost two-thirds of what was expected. <sup>3</sup>

Despite the poor attendance of the physical forces behind the movement, the Irish Rebels were able to take the city of Dublin with relatively little bloodshed.<sup>4</sup>  By midday, a little over 1,000 men and women marched toward their positions, under the leadership of George Plunkett.<sup>5</sup>  The battalions split and took strategic buildings to fortify their stance in the city: Éamon de Valera’s Volunteers of the Third Battalion occupied the Westland Train Station and Boland’s Bakery; Commandant Edward Daly’s Volunteers of the First Battalion, the Four Courts; Éamonn Ceant’s Fourth Battalion of Volunteers the South Union Dublin; the Volunteers of the Second Battalion, Jacob’s Biscuit Factory; the Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan, St.Stephen’s Green under the leadership of Commandant Michael Mallin; and Patrick Pearse and James Connolly took the majority of their forces to the GPO (General Post Office) which would become the headquarter of the Rebellion.<sup>6</sup>  Due to the lack of man power, the Irish were able to secure the North, East, and West of Dublin surrounding the Dublin Castle, but not the South. This failure, or ‘incomplete occupation’ would later prove to be detrimental as it led to the arrival of over 4,000 British troops via Kingstown Station by the end of the Rising.<sup>7</sup>

At 12:45 p.m., following the taking of the GPO, Patrick Pearse, the figure head or the Rising, formally proclaimed the Irish Republic while reading the Proclamation of the Republic. Simultaneously, two flags were raised on the building: one solid green with the Fianna Harp and “Irish Republic” embroidered in gold; the other a new tricolor green, white, and orange design.<sup>8</sup>  The confusion and hastiness of the Rising lead to little military response from the British for the first two days, as there were only 400 of 2,400 British soldiers in Ireland available for service at the time. This lack of a large British presence in response to the Rising meant the first two days consisted of small street fighting skirmishes and long range sniper duels, and it allowed those who had ignored or not received the initial call to arms to join the rebels in large numbers as well as easy communication between rebel garrisons.<sup>9</sup>  The only major loss for the Rebels at this time was at St. Stephen’s Green, which was unable to be fully fortified by the Irish Citizen Army and Cumann na mBan and forced Commandant Mallin to withdraw and reestablish their stronghold at the Royal College of Surgeons.<sup>10</sup>  During this time society in Dublin seemed to carry on as normal other than Lord Lieutenant Lord Wimborne’s declaration of Marshall law in Dublin on Tuesday the 25th which he extended to all of Ireland the next day.<sup>11</sup>  

The harsh military assault that the Rebels expected from the British began with the artillery shelling of Dublin at 8 a.m. on the morning of Wednesday the 26th from the British ship Helga and four 18lb field guns stationed at Trinity College.<sup>12</sup>  The shelling was accompanied by a southern assault on Mount Street Bridge that would become the bloodiest battle of the Rising, and also caused almost half of all British casualties. For nine hours, seventeen of Éamon de Valera’s men from Third Battalion of Irish Volunteers held off a full-frontal assault from 2,000 of General Lowe’s men from the 2/7th and 2/8th battalions, which had just arrived via the unsecured Kingstown Station, for nine hours.<sup>13</sup>  Following this incident, the British Army abandoned the tactic of full-frontal assault in favor of surrounding and isolating other garrisons, allowing them to advance on the GPO.<sup>14</sup>

Though passion and determination allowed for the Irish Rebels to be a formidable adversary for the British, they were still the lesser force in numbers and supplies. Most guns used by the Rebels were antiques that varied in design from revolvers to shot guns, and only fired once before needing to be reloaded, including the Mauser rifles that had been acquired  two years prior in the Howth gun-running exploit of 1914.<sup>15</sup>  These variations in weaponry called for a variation in ammunition, which was running in short supply for the Rebels, as well as food which they were forced to ration.<sup>16</sup>  By Thursday night, the GPO and all Rebel garrisons were surrounded as shelling increased, causing an intense fire throughout the city. Circumstances further deteriorated on Friday for the Rebels when the GPO caught fire, forcing the Rebels to retreat and seek shelter in the Moore Street tenement houses where they began a futile attempt to tunnel through the connected walls back toward Sackville Lane and the GPO.<sup>17</sup>  That same morning, General Friend was replaced by Major-General Sir John Maxwell, who temporarily became Governor General of Ireland.<sup>18</sup>  Maxwell made his position on the current situation and how he intended to end it clear: he had no qualms with destroying all buildings occupied or near the Rebels unless they gave unconditional surrender.<sup>19</sup>

On Saturday April 29th, 1916, at 12:45 p.m., exactly six days to the minute after the establishment of the Irish Republic, Elizabeth O’Farrell approached the British military cordons with a makeshift white flag to inform them that Patrick Pearse was ready to discuss terms of surrender.<sup>20</sup>  Several hours later after multiple unsuccessful attempts to improve the terms of surrender, Patrick Pearse met General Lowe at the top of Moore Street at 3:30 p.m. to offer his unconditional surrender.<sup>21</sup>  The garrison at Four Courts surrendered the same day and the other Rebel garrisons begrudgingly followed suit the next day.<sup>22</sup>

**Women in the Rising:**

The Rising of 1916 had quite a few intricacies interwoven into its core that made it unique for the early 20th Century, one of which being the role of women. The role the estimated 200 women played in the Rising was invaluable, and provided various forms of support.<sup>23</sup>  Though it seems to have been an incredibly progressive Rising considering the amount of women involved, they were mostly relegated to ‘women’s work’ within the Rebel garrisons. Many of the women spent the Rising in the kitchens, washing, and tending to the wounded; there were of course exceptions to this.<sup>24</sup>  Though many of the women were unarmed, they still found ways to be a part of immediate action. Women risked their lives as couriers to supply food and ammunitions, as well as maintain Rebel communications or work as scouts to facilitate movement.<sup>25</sup>  

The most accepting branch to women in a prominent role was the ICA (Irish Citizen Army), which had their own female branch in Cumann na mBan. The differing experiences of women during the Rising based on the branches they joined is due to the differing ideological beliefs and drives behind the branche’s involvements, as they varied from religious, socialist, and cultural motivations. The ICA (Irish Citizen Army) was originally a protection of workers movement, and therefore one of the founding members James Connolly emphasized the equal treatment of woman and the the suffrage of women as an integral part of the ICA philosophy.<sup>26</sup>  Due to the role of women heavily influencing their doctrine, the ICA had the highest amount of military involvement of women, including that of Countess Constance Markievicz who was second in command during the taking of St. Stephen’s Green and credited with at least one kill of the opposition.<sup>27</sup>

Though even within the ICA there were difficulties faced in women’s desire to take an active role in the Rising and contradictory accounts supporting both claims. Marie Perolz felt frustrated by the patronizing question posed by Commandant Mallin on her messenger duties: “Is it dangerous enough for you?” while another reported being told the ICA only mobilized Cumann na mBan due to the lack of men, as they were not mobilized until late Monday night after their leaders protested their exclusion at the GPO.<sup>28</sup>  However one woman cited the Proclamation to insist on her right to be an active participant and throw a grenade, burn down a hotel, and was even shot three times during her infantry activity.<sup>29</sup>  The women who were in the Volunteers branch had to disobey direct orders to participate and gain access to the garrisons.<sup>30</sup>

In the end, though women played a crucial role in the Easter Rising, their male comrades still saw them as different. Their role was a contentious one, varying from commander to commander: de Valera refused to have any women present in his garrison; James Connolly passed out revolvers to the women, yet refused to allow his daughter to fight at the GPO and stationed them where there was likely to be very little fighting.<sup>31</sup>   Many men even insisted that women run home before British assault began and the fall of the Republic, which most women refused.<sup>32</sup>  By the fall of the Republic a total of 80 women were taken into custody. Irish Rebels and British soldiers alike attempted to convince them to simply return to their homes, the women present had to vehemently insist on being arrested to the British officers.<sup>33</sup>  In all only five women, including Countess Markievicz, were sent to prison and the rest were cited as being ‘mislead’ by the men surrounding them and sent home.<sup>34</sup>

**Religion in the Rising:**

The role of religion in the Easter Rising was an undeniable factor, as an overwhelming number of those fighting were Catholics, in fact the only Protestant leader of the Rising was Countess Markievicz, who ended up converting to Catholicism.<sup>35</sup>  The rebellion even held claims of approval from the Vatican, as Count Plunkett told the Archbishop of Dublin that he himself had visited the Pope who blessed their desire to “act as Catholics.”<sup>36</sup>  This idea that they were acting for God reinforced the spirit of the Rebels, one even claimed if he died in the fighting without confession he “would go straight to heaven if I die here.”<sup>37</sup>  The event was steeped in the spirit of Catholicism, and there were many claims that divine intervention protected the Rebels from snipers as they kneeled to pray.<sup>38</sup>  Many prepared for the Rising itself with religious devotions throughout the weekend; the piety of the Rebels won over the skeptical public and changed public opinion of them positively.<sup>39</sup>  Few Protestants fought on the Rebel side of the Rising, and were often placed in more dangerous lookout spots.<sup>40</sup>

## Digital Background

The Easter Rising of 1916 has recently celebrated the 100th anniversary of the failed rebellions attempt to overthrow British rule. The centennial event, celebrated in Ireland, led to many colleges and institutions trying to create digital projects to commemorate the rebellion. There is a myriad of ways in which these projects represent some type of digital scholarship on the rebellion. Some institutions made simple maps and pictures concerning the events surrounding the rebellion while others, collected a massive number of primary sources that have been digitized to be accessed by the public.

Institutions like the Glasnevin Trust and ArcGIS made lists of those who died with additional information for the sake of either just having a comprehensive list or for the sake of creating a tutorial for how to make maps using their program (ArcGIS). Boston College, the National Library of Ireland, and the Irish times created databases for access to literature and speeches related to the Rebellion. The Irish Times shows the importance of the 1916 Easter Rising both contemporary to the Rebellion and now. The Boston College project for the Easter Rising in collaboration with segments of the Irish government and The Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, contains the most amount of information in one place along with interviews with historians and with readings of the literature of the Rebellion. The National Library of Ireland has collected the works of the biggest names of the Rebellion and have links to PDF scans of their writings.
