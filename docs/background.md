According to government data, we are currently experiencing some of the lowest unemployment rates in recent decades. This is very positive news for the American people, however, this arbitrary number might not tell a complete story. The nation is experiencing a phenomenon where millions of work-eligible men have simply left the workforce. [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/2016/09/06/492849471/an-economic-mystery-why-are-men-leaving-the-workforce) By not actively searching for a job, they are no longer considered in the "unemployment" calculations. 

There is a shortage in many occupations that require formal education as we explain in the example of Nursing and Healthcare. This discussion is meant to expand on the disparity between skilled and unskilled jobs, education requirements and economics needs specific to the Tampa Bay Area.

## Historical Background

The shortage of Nurses in the state of Florida is so high that it is the most in demand occupation in the state of Florida. An article from Politifact details that the number of ads for nurses is almost double for the second place in-demand occupation. [www.politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/nov/08/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-right-about-need-more-nurses-state/) Nursing is followed by retail, customer service, and truck driving positions, jobs which do not normally require formal secondary education. 

This need for nurses has regularly been ranked on top for the past seven years, according to the state’s Agriculture Commissioner, Adam Scott. [www.politifact.com](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2017/nov/08/adam-putnam/adam-putnam-right-about-need-more-nurses-state/) This massive need for Nurses is due to a number of factors. One of which being Florida’s large elderly population that requires very demanding expectations. [www.tampabay.com](http://www.tampabay.com/news/health/florida-facing-a-nursing-shortage-tsunami-due-to-increased-population-more/2263588) Another factor is increase of insured citizens due to the Obama-instituted health care policy. (www.tampabay.com) The more patients using these services increases the demand of health care professionals. 

While Nursing is generally a stable career financially providing a comfortable salary, compared to other state’s, Florida nursing salaries are on the low-end. (www.tambabay.com) This is another factor to consider when advertising the need for more registered nurses. Out-of-state nurses or potential students would be more interested in the field if they knew could anticipate an even higher salary. 

Florida Governor Rick Scott, proudly shares that Florida has improved job creation by the thousands year over year. However, the number one industry of these new jobs has been hospitality… a market that does not immediately require professional degrees. [www.baynews9.com](http://www.baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2018/06/15/tampa-adds-more-than-thirty-thousand-jobs-over-the-year) We are forming a conclusion that there is a large disparity between education-required jobs and unskilled occupations. Maybe there is a lack of interest for certain degree fields and yet the in-demand unskilled jobs do not provide the economic incentive for other viable workers.
