# Project Background

The Congressional Medal of Honor is a very important award for a member of the United States Military to receive. There have been over three thousand recipients of the Medal of Honor. With so many recipients, a number of historical questions about the recipients should be desired to be answeres. These questions can include, "Which branch of the U.S. Military contains the most recipients?", "How many recipients are still on this earth?", "Which ranks recieved the most medals?" and other questions. I think that there can be much to learn from the study of these Medal of Honor recipients and their deeds. It is the purpose of this project to answer historical questions about the recipients of the Medal of Honor based on the historical data which is there.

Since its establishment, the Congressional Medal of Honor has been awarded to around 3000 members of the United States Military. Members of the United States Marines, Army, Air Force, and the Navy have received the Medal of Honor. One person from the United States Coast Guard has received the Medal of Honor as well. The Medal of Honor has been given to soldiers who served in conflicts such as the Indian Wars, the American Civil War, and World War II. People of different ranks such as Private and even Boatswain have received the MEdal of Honor. A minority of Medal of Honor reipients are actually still on earth to this day. Each individual who has recieved the Medal of Honor has their own story. There is interesting information which can be learned from those stories.
