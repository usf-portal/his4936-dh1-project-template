This word map highlights key terms and concepts that Clinton discussed during his State of the Union Addresses.  All but two of the terms are mentioned in all eight of his addresses, but they are all central to the message he was presenting to the American people. One of the terms that is not mentioned in all of the speeches is “21st,” but the frequency of the term steadily increases as the dawn of the 21st centenary grew closer and falls again in the year 2000.
