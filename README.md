## Project Template

The purpose of this project, known as the Medals of Honor project, is to analyze historical data relating to Medal of Honor recipients and to answer historical questions based on that data. Questions such as, "Which ranks of which military branches received the most Medals of Honor?", Which branches of the United States Military have received the least and most amount of medals?", and "How many Medal of Honor recipients are still on earth today?" will be answered. The data about te Medal of Honor recipients was scraped from the website of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Each recipient has their own webpage profile which contains information about their place and date of birth, military branch, rank, and more. 

See the [Course Workbook Project Page](https://hacking-history.readthedocs.io/project) for more information on the final project.

## Workflow

The list below walks you through the process of how to get and make changes to the final project. Don't just send all your changes to your group leader at the last minute. As you complete various phases of your work, send your changes back to your project manager's develop branch.

1. Setting Up...
    * The project manager will fork the [final project template repository](https://github.com/usf-portal/his4936-dh1-project-template).
    * Each group member will fork their project manager's template
    * Each group member will then make a sub-branch of the 'develop' branch named 'users/your-username' (without the quotes, and substituting your own username)
2. Working on the Project
    * The project manager is the only one allowed to change the 'master' or 'develop' branches
    * As they go, each group member (even the project manager) will only make direct changes to their own 'users/your-username' branch
    * When you complete any phase of your work and you want to make it available to your group, send a pull request to the 'develop' of your project manager
    * At this point, the project manager can approve or deny changes to the workbook, or ask you for further revisions.
    * Once the pull request is approved, everyone can sync the changes into their own repositories.
3. Intros, Credits, and Getting Ready to Publish
    * The project manager (or someone else, if selected) **must** edit README.md, mkdocs.yml, docs/index.md docs/credits.md to reflect any credits, summary, or introductory material you want. If you add new .md files or change the names of existing ones, you must edit mkdocs.yml to reflect that change.
    * When you want to change the 'master' branch, the project manager will launch a pull request from the 'develop' branch to the 'master' branch, and then approve it.
3. Submitting and Reviewing
    * When you are all done and the master branch of the project manager looks like you want it to, the project manager will launch a pull request from their master branch to mine.
    * I will then make comments on the pull request itself, and close it (because I don't want it to change the original template) when I am done reviewing it.
    * You are done!
