## Project Template

My project will examine and analyze the death rates throughout the years in Mexico as a whole and how it has either gotten worse or better. Although I will mention the cartel killings and the murders that take place, I will mainly focus on the health of the country as a whole by discussing the different diseases and illness that affect Mexico. I will gather information from various sources including the Mexican government and other international sources. I plan on cleaning up the data I do find and creating a visualization using Tableau.
